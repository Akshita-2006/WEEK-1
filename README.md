## 🚗 EV Adoption Forecasting

This project aims to forecast the future adoption rates of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using historical data and machine learning techniques. As EV adoption continues to grow, accurately predicting demand is critical for infrastructure planning, energy distribution, and environmental policy.

Using datasets such as electric vehicle population counts by region or time, this notebook explores trends and applies forecasting models (e.g., time series, regression, or ensemble learning) to estimate future EV adoption percentages.

### 🔍 Key Features

- Data preprocessing and exploration of EV adoption rates
- Outlier detection and handling using the IQR method
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Visualization of adoption trends and forecasted values
- Focus on sustainable transportation and real-world applications

### 📊 Use Cases

- Government bodies can use forecasts for infrastructure planning
- Utility companies can prepare for increased energy demand
- Automotive sectors can plan production based on future trends
- Academics or students can learn time-series/data forecasting
